# Game Ideas

***Aqeel***

Outer Wilds is an action-adventure video game set in an open world. In this game, the player has only 22 minutes to locate their own characters on the planet before the sun goes supernova and kills the player character.

I would make a pakistani version of game Grand Theft Auto. In my version of Grand Theft Auto will be an action-adventure game played from either a third-person or first-person perspective. Players complete missions based on real life scenarios with set objectives to progress through the story. Outside of the missions, players may freely roam the open world. Composed of the major cities like karachi, Lahore, Islamabad some open countryside area, beaches, the world is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series of GTA. It may be fully explored after the game's beginning without restriction, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content.
